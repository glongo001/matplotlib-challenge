I analized data obtained by Pymaceuticals, Inc. for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). I analyzed their results treating 249 mice with different drug treatments over 45 days. 
- First, I created a table diaplying summary statistics, such as mean tumor volume, median tumor volume, tumor volume variance, tumor volume standard deviation, and tumor volume standard error.
    - The results of this table implied that Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective treatments.
- I obtained the number of mice treated with each drug regimen and displayed the results in a bar graph. I discovered that more mice were treated with Capomulin and Ramicane.
- I obtained the number of male and female mice treated and displayed the results in a pie chart. 51% of mice treated were male and 49% of mice treated were female.
- I separated the data of the top 4 performing regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. I obtained the quartiles(25%, 50%, and 75%) for the final tumor volume and calculated the upper and lower bounds to determine outliers. Only Infubinol had an outlier. I displayed the final tumor volume for each of these treatments in a boxplot, here Capomulin and Ramicane showed lower final Tumor Volumes than Infubinol and Ceftamin.
- I displayed the tumor volume of a mouse treated with Capomulin over time. The results showed that tumor volume decreased over time.
- I displayed the weight and average tumor volume of mice treated with capomulin, there was a strong correlation showing that as weight increased average tumor volume increased.
